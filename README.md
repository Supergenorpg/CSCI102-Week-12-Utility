# CSCI 102 - Section E
# Week 12 - Part A
# I completed this lab by using the coding skills I learned throughout this class and CSCI 101. 
# The only issue I had was getting rid of \n that are created from the .readlines() function.
# I solved this by googling it and found the .read().splitlines() function that did not create newlines.
